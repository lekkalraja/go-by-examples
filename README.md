### Panic

* A `panic` typically means something went unexpectedly wrong. Mostly we use it to fail fast on errors that shouldn’t occur during normal operation, or that we aren’t prepared to handle gracefully.

* A common use of panic is to abort if a function returns an error value that we don’t know how to (or want to) handle.

* Note that unlike some languages which use exceptions for handling of many errors, in Go it is idiomatic to use error-indicating return values wherever possible.

### Defer

* `Defer` is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program’s execution, usually for purposes of cleanup. 
* defer is often used where e.g. `ensure` and `finally` would be used in other languages.

* Suppose we wanted to create a file, write to it, and then close when we’re done. Here’s how we could do that with defer.

    ```go
        func main() {
            f := createFile("/tmp/defer.txt")
            defer closeFile(f)
            writeFile(f)
        }
    ```
* It’s important to check for errors when closing a file, even in a deferred function.

    ```go
        func closeFile(f *os.File) {
            fmt.Println("closing")
            err := f.Close()
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error: %v\n", err)
                os.Exit(1)
            }
        }
    ```

### Closures

* Go supports `anonymous functions`, which can form `closures`. 
* Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it.

* The function `intSeq` returns another function, which we define anonymously in the body of intSeq. `The returned function closes over the variable i to form a closure.`

    ```go
        func intSeq() func() int {
            i := 0
            return func() int {
                i++
                return i
            }
        }
    ```
* We call intSeq, assigning the result (a function) to nextInt. This function value captures its own i value, which will be updated each time we call nextInt.

* `To confirm that the state is unique to that particular function, create and test a new one`.

    ```go
        func main() {
            nextInt := intSeq()
            fmt.Println(nextInt())
            fmt.Println(nextInt())
            fmt.Println(nextInt())

            newInts := intSeq()
            fmt.Println(newInts())
        }
    ```
